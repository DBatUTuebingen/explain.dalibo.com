      <p>
        This app was inspired and heavily influenced by the excellent <a href="https://explain.depesz.com">explain.depesz.com</a>. Both the tool and the corresponding help files are a great resource to learn about Postgres and its planner.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's also heavily inspired by <a href="http://tatiyants.com/pev/">PEV</a> of which it can be considered a fork.

        Usage tips
      </h3>
      <h4>
        Format
      </h4>
      <p>
        To get the most out of it, we recommend generating a query plan using the following line: <code>EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, COSTS, VERBOSE, BUFFERS, FORMAT JSON)</code>. It is recommend submitting a (decently formatted) SQL query that generated the plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEV2 <b>can also parse text</b> although the JSON format usually has better support.
      </p>
      <h4>
        POST
      </h4>
      <p>
        You can send plans using <em>HTTP POST</em>.
        <br>
        Here's an example using <em>cURL</em>:
        <br>
        <code class="text-muted ml-4 d-block">$ curl -Ls -w %{url_effective} -d '{"plan":"Result  (cost=0.00..0.01 rows=1 width=32)"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST https://explain.dalibo.com/new -o /dev/null | xargs xdg-open</code>
      </p>

      <p>
        All plans and queries are saved in a database so that you can access them later or share them. If you don't want your plans to be saved you can either:
        <ul>
          <li>use the <b>delete link</b> provided when the plan is posted to remove the data from database,</li>
          <li>use the standalone (<em>browser only</em>) version of this app available at <a href="https://dalibo.github.io/pev2/">https://dalibo.github.io/pev2/</a>.</li>
        </ul>
